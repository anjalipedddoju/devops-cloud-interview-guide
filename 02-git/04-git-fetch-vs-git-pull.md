## Question  
What is the difference between `git fetch` and `git pull`, and when would you use each?

### 📝 Short Explanation  
This question checks if you understand how Git handles remote updates. Many developers use `git pull` out of habit but don’t realize that it’s a combination of two actions — which `git fetch` separates for more control.

## ✅ Answer  
- `git fetch` retrieves the latest changes from the remote repository **without merging** them into your current branch. show changes
- `git pull` does the same as `fetch` but **also automatically merges** the changes into your current branch. do changes

### 📘 Detailed Explanation  
When you run `git fetch`, you’re asking Git to contact the remote (like GitHub) and download any changes (new commits, branches, tags) — **but not apply them** to your working directory.

```bash
git fetch origin
```

This is useful when:
- You want to see what others have pushed
- You're preparing for a manual merge or rebase
- You want to avoid surprise changes to your working branch

With `git pull`, you're doing this **plus** merging the changes into your current branch in one step:

```bash
git pull origin main
```

That’s shorthand for:
```bash
git fetch origin
git merge origin/main
```

While `git pull` is faster, it can cause **unintended merges** if you’re not ready. That’s why many teams prefer doing `fetch` first, reviewing the changes, and then merging or rebasing manually.

> Summary:  
> Use `git fetch` when you want control.  
> Use `git pull` when you’re ready to sync changes directly.
